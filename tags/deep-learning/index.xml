      <description>I came across a great episode while listening to Software Engineering Radio the other day while on my morning walk.
Episode 391 features Jeremy Howard from fast.ai explaining deep learning from concept to implementation.
I had heard of fast.ai before in an Elixir meetup where I met a gentlemen who designs machine learning systems for monitoring people in hospital beds. The system uses visual detection aided by deep learning to alert staff if a patient has fallen from their bed hopefully getting the patient the help they need more quickly.</description>
