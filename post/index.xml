      <description>When working between projects, I realize that I almost always repeat the same few tasks including:
 Typing cd &amp;lt;path&amp;gt; to enter the project directory Typing git fetch or git pull to check/merge any changes upstream Typing &amp;lt;Ctrl&amp;gt;-b , while in tmux to rename the window to the project name  By incorporating the wonderful command-line fuzzy finder fzf I wrote a small bash function called cdp to automate these steps.</description>

      <description>I came across a great episode while listening to Software Engineering Radio the other day while on my morning walk.
Episode 391 features Jeremy Howard from fast.ai explaining deep learning from concept to implementation.
I had heard of fast.ai before in an Elixir meetup where I met a gentlemen who designs machine learning systems for monitoring people in hospital beds. The system uses visual detection aided by deep learning to alert staff if a patient has fallen from their bed hopefully getting the patient the help they need more quickly.</description>
